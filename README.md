This is the repository for my 4th year project from [Atlantic Technology University](http://atu.ie)
***
# What is in this repository?

This GitHub repository will contain my work from the Emerging Technology module.
It will contain jupyter notebooks, generated using Jupyter Lite, about topics we discussed in class and I have researched outside of class time
***
There are 5 notebooks inside this repository, each from sections covered, in each notebook you will find a nice bland of written explanations and python examples and graphs.

The 5 Topics Covered:
0) Python (auto-generated with JupyterLite).
1) GitHub Pages (hosts the instance of JL, but NB contains details about it).
2) JupyterLite (What it is and does).
3) Computation.
4) The Fourier Transform
5) Quantum Computing
